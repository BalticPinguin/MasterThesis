\label{ch:res}
In the previous chapters, many different methods that can be used to compute PESs numerically are described and in chapter \ref{ch:proced} the method used within this work is described in more detail.
In this chapter some results are shown and explained.

Since the method developed in this work combines several techniques that have not been used together so far and several conceptual questions need to be clarified before computing actual PESs, is section \ref{ch:BCbench} two BCs are compared in their influence on the wave-function. In section \ref{sec:NumConve} further benchmarking calculations on some numerical parameters are shown.
For simplicity, these calculations were performed using a Lithium atom as test system.

In section \ref{ch:resLI} further results for atomic Lithium are presented, showing several conceptual ... .

\section{Comparison of Boundary Conditions}
\label{ch:BCbench}
In section \ref{ch:BC}, many BCs which give rise to diverse properties for the solution are briefly described.
Detailed comparisons of some of these BCs are studied in various works \cite{babuska,artBC,capComp,absRev,nrBCrev} for several systems.
For simplicity, here only two BCs are studied in more detail.
First, in section \ref{sec:DBCbench} several properties of the grids introduced in section \ref{sec:grid} are studied with Dirichlet boundaries which are particularly easy to set up and understand in their physical consequences.
In section \ref{sec:iBCbench}, several properties of the mesh with infinite elements are investigated.
Since it turns out that the solutions obtained with infinite elements are very sensitive to the parameters, this study is performed more extensively.
For simplicity, the tests shown here are on atomic systems using, unless specified otherwise, an analytic Coulomb potential with charge $1$, corresponding to the ionised hydrogen atom.

\subsection{Dirichlet Boundary Condition}
\label{sec:DBCbench}
Dirichlet boundaries are conceptually the easiest BCs but are known to have a large influence on the solution, especially for continuous functions since they reflect outgoing waves fully.
%\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.6\textwidth}
%\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Figures/BC/DBCenergies}

%\label{fig:dbcRad}
%\end{wrapfigure}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/BC/DirichletBC}
\caption{Several properties of the solutions obtained with Dirichlet BCs using different box sizes:\\

\label{fig:dbcRad}
\end{figure}
Moreover, its requirement for the solutions to vanish at the boundaries results in an artificial discretisation of the radial solution similar to that of bound states which leads to a banded spectrum with a size-dependent energy gap between two states with same angular momentum.
Moreover, these boundaries enforce the real and imaginary part of the solution to be identical up to symmetry operations (such as rotations and reflections for spherical systems) which does not hold for continuum waves such as Coulomb waves as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:RadFun} and plane waves that have a constant phase shift.

These properties are found in various tests conducted to find reasonable parameters for application to more complex systems.
In Figure \ref{fig:dbcRad} a), the error in the energy of $20$ solutions is shown for different radii.
The comparison with the red line that represents a cubic decay, shows that the error is inverse proportional to the volume of the box which is a well-known result for particles in a box with infinite potential walls. 
The number of spheres is kept constant at $N=20$.
The influence of the number of spheres on the energies is shown in the panels c) and d) of Figure \ref{fig:dbcRad}.
In these figures several branches of solutions can be seen that correspond to different angular momenta.
For smaller radii ($r=4$, panel c)), these branches are well-separated but become closer and finally interfere with each other at larger radii ($r=10$, panel d)) where also strong coupling of angular momenta can occur.
Following the expectations, the energies of the respective branches decay when the number of degrees of freedom is increased.
The lowest panels in Figure \ref{fig:dbcRad} show the contributions from plane wave functions with respective kinetic energy and different angular momentum where the partial wave coefficient is defined as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:PartWaveCoeff}
|\langle \Psi_\text{num} | \Psi_{\vec{k}}^\text{Sph}\rangle |^2
\end{equation}
where $|\Psi_{vec{k}}^\text{Sph}\rangle$ is the spherical wave (\ref{eq:spherWave}) and $|\Psi_\text{num}\rangle$ denotes the respective numerically obtained solution.
For numerical reasons, here the comparison is done against the spherical waves and not against Coulomb waves.
In Figure \ref{fig:dbcRad} b), two solutions with $l=2$ along one axis are shown (the fifth one for $r=4$ and the first one for $r=10$) for two different box-sizes and compared to the Coulomb wave.

However, the density of solutions is not the only important quantity: To obtain reasonable intensities, the respective angular momentum is more important to obtain reasonable results.
Respective tests show that for a given energy of the photoelectron of $E=0.566\,$ Hartree the obtained solutions have a well-defined angular momentum only for small boxes where the critical radius is in the order of $r_\text{max}=10\,$bohr.
For larger meshes, the states have large contributions from different angular momenta and are very sensitive to different parameters such as the number of spheres $N_i$ and the parameters $p$ and $q$ of the distributions of the spheres (\ref{eq:tm_map}) and (\ref{eq:son_map}) respectively.
Moreover, for example the comparison of the Figures \ref{fig:dbcRad} e) and f) shows that solutions on larger meshes tend to have higher angular momenta which is an important argument in favour of smaller boxes since for most atomic systems angular momenta larger than $4$ are not of interest.

%\subsection{Complex Absorbing Potential}
%Using a CAP as described in section \ref{ch:cap}, two additional degrees of freedom comared to the Dirichlet BCs arise: the strength $\eta$ of the artificial potential (\ref{eq:cap}) and the offset $r_0$ where it starts, the latter has the only restriction to be larger than the radius of the DO.
%In section \ref{ch:cap} it was suggested to chose the parameters such that the respective derivatives of the energy vanish \cite{CAPccEOM,CAPfreshlook}.
%This procedure is, however, only valid if one solution should be taken into account and thus is not directly applicable here.
%Interpreting the real part of the eigenvalues of the eigenproblem (\ref{eq:SEmat}) as the energy of the respective state, the influence of the CAP on the density of states varies strongly when changing other parameters.

\subsection{Infinite Elements}
\label{sec:iBCbench}
In section \ref{ch:InfEl}, several formulations of infinite elements are presented.

which require some investigation to get an understanding of the properties of the numerical setup described so far.
Among these questions is the formulation of infinite elements, discussed in section \ref{ch:InfEl} of which the most important ones are studied in section \ref{ch:bmFormul}.
\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{0.5\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/BC/plane_fin}
\caption{2D-cut of a solution with infinite elemnts using a spherical finite element region indicated by the red circle with a radius of $r=6\,$bohr and $N=11$ spheres.}
\label{fig:cutInf}
\end{wrapfigure}
In Figure \ref{fig:cutInf}, a 2D-cut of a solution obtained with infinite elements for the Hydrogen atom is shown, the red circle indicates the region of finite elements.
The features shown in Figure \ref{fig:cutInf} are prototypic for the properties that are found for the infinite elements here.
It is clearly visible from the graph that the infinite region resembles the asymtotic behaviour, showing the expected regular oscillations of an outgoing wave.
However, the angular momentum is quite large, leading to only small contributions in the finite element region.

%\subsubsection{Formulation of Infinite Elements}
\subsubsection{Comparison of Formulations}
\label{ch:bmFormul}
Before having a closer look at the convergence of different parameters, first the formulation of infinite elements to be used later is investigated.
Since the unconjugated Burnett-formulation was not very successful \cite{dreyer}, the conjugated formulations of Burnett and Astley-Leis both have interesting features to use for quantum mechanical problems.
Since the conjugated Burnett elements lead to infinitely large matrix elements, here the Astley-Leis elements (\ref{eq:ALelem}) are compared with the symmetrised form (\ref{eq:ALsymm}) using different powers $p$.
Moreover, to study the influence of the damping function in the Astley-Leis formulation (\ref{eq:ALelem}) in more detail, also a test function space similar to eq. (\ref{eq:ALelem}) but using the squared damping function $D(r)^2$ instead of $D(r)$.

The 50 real solutions whose energy is closest to the target value of $15.44\,$eV ($0.5675\,E_h$) obtained with the original Astley-Leis formulations with the damping function taken to the powers $p=1,2$ as well as the symmetrised formulation (\ref{eq:ALsymm}) suggested in this thesis with powers $p<0.5$ are shown in Figure \ref{fig:IFEMform_spect}.
For the unsymmetric formulations only the real part is shown which is assigned to the physical energy of the respective state.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/IFem_form_spectra}
\caption{The first 50 eigenvalues obtained with the original Astley-Leis formulation (imaginary part not shown) and with the symmetrised form (\ref{eq:ALsymm}).}
\label{fig:IFEMform_spect}
\end{figure}
The results shown in Figure \ref{fig:IFEMform_spect} show clearly that the obtained density of states decreases with the power $p$ and converges for $p\approx \frac 18$ for the given parameters (the radial mapping scheme (\ref{eq:tm_map}) is used with $N=25$, $l=0.5$, $p=2.5$ and $r_\text{max}=7\,$bohr.).

The dependence of the obtained spectrum of the Hamiltonian on the power of the damping function shows that, at least for FEFs, the asymptotic behaviour is crucial for the properties of the wave function. 
The dependence converges for $p=1/8$, see also Figure \ref{fig:powerSpect} in supplement.
Moreover, even for small powers $p\approx 10^{-4}$, no numerical instabilities are observable so that there is some freedom in this parameter and it does not need to be optimised for different systems individually.
The observations made on the convergence-properties using the spectrum in Figure \ref{fig:IFEMform_spect} are supported by the projections of the solutions on spherical waves of which some are shown in Figure \ref{fig:IFEMform_project}.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Ifem_forms}
\caption{Decomposition of the first 30 solutions into spherical waves with angular momenta up to $l=7$.
Left: Astley-Leis-formulation ($p=1$), middle: symmetrised form ($p=0.5$) right: symmetrised form ($p=10^{-4}$).}
\label{fig:IFEMform_project}
\end{figure}

As shown in the Figure \ref{fig:IFEMform_project}, the nature of the states obtained is in all cases strongly mixed in the quantum number $l$ with significant contributions even for $l>7$.
However, the relative contributions of the angular momenta critically depends on the power $p$, making a reasonable choice of this parameter important.
Further it is expected that the convergence of $p$ depends on further parameters such as the box-size and kinetic energy of the photoelectron which is, however, not studied here in more detail.
Instead, in the following the power of the damping function $D$ is chosen to be $p=0.0001$ if not specified differently.
This value is far in the convergence region of Figure \ref{fig:IFEMform_project} and thus is hoped to be reasonable also for other systems.

%\subsection{Size of Finite Element Region}
\subsubsection{Radius of the Finite Element Region}
\label{ch:bmSize}
%More important than the subspace used numerically is obviously the size of the sphere used for the FEM description.
Similarly to the Dirichlet BCs discussed in section \ref{sec:DBCbench}, also for infinite element the size of the finite element region has a strong influence on the solution, even if the dependency is weaker as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:InfBoxs} where the energy of the energies closest to the target value is plotted for different box sizes.
However, the energy-dependence on the box-size is much weaker than in the case of Dirichlet BCs as the comparison with the $\frac{1}{r^3}$-curve in Figure \ref{fig:InfBoxs} and \ref{fig:dbcRad} (a) shows.
\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{0.6\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Figures/BC/BoxsInfEL}
\caption{Double-logarithmic plot of the error in energy for different radii of the finite element region.}
\label{fig:InfBoxs}
\end{wrapfigure}
Moreover, the error in energy is in general much lower with infinite elements which is a further indicate for the higher accuracy of infinite elements compared to the Dirichlet boundaries.
On the other side, also the angular momenta of the solutions are larger than those occurring with Dirichlet BC at the same box-size.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/RadWave_p0_001.pdf}
\caption{The eigenenergies for different box sizes (coloured dots in the upper panel) where the box size is denoted by the colour in atomic units.
The lower panel shows the decomposition of the solutions into spherical waves for three box sizes, marked by a star in the colour bar respectively.}
\label{fig:RadWaves}
\end{figure}
This behaviour is observed to depend also on the formulation of infinite elements.
Respective tests show, \textit{e.g.}, that the mixing of angular momenta is stronger for smaller damping powers $p$.
This coupling of different angular momenta can be explained by the very density of the spectrum which increases with the radius as shown \textit{e.g.} in Figure \ref{fig:RadWaves} but increases also with descending damping as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:IFEMform_project}.

This behaviour can be understood when recapitulating the influence of small perturbations (\textit{e.g.} due to numerical cut-off) in form of a matrix $\mat{E}$ of an hermitian matrix to its eigenvectors $\vec{u}_i$ which has the form \cite{saad, wilkinson}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ErrVect}
\vec{u}'_i=\sum_{j\neq i} \frac{\vec{u}_j^\dagger\mat{E}\vec{u}_i}{\lambda_i-\lambda_j} \vec{u}_j
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_i$ is the eigenvector corresponding to $\vec{u}_i$.
From eq. (\ref{eq:ErrVect}) now the coupling of angular momenta and strong dependence on the parameters for a dense spectrum, \textit{i.e.} small $\lambda_i-\lambda_j$ becomes obvious.

\subsubsection{Density of Spheres}
\label{sec:BenchSphere}
Increasing the number of spheres has, as expected, some influence on the energies but also changes the angular momenta of the solutions.
Similar to the behaviour found for Dirichlet BCs, also when using infinite element BCs a larger number of spheres leads to larger angular momenta as the comparison of the partial wave coefficients in Figure \ref{fig:InfNum} for different numbers of spheres shows.
Moreover, the error of the energy shown on the left side of Figure \ref{fig:InfNum} indicates that the shown configurations are far from saturation.
However, since high angular momenta are not desireable, a smaller number of spheres is better suited even though it is not converged.
Moreover, the behaviour of the properties of the solutions when changing the number of spheres is not very systematic in the range shown.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/BC/NumInfEL}
\caption{The energy (left panel) and partial wave coefficient (\ref{eq:PartWaveCoeff}) for different number of spheres $N$ using infinite elements. The radius is $r=10\,$bohr.}
\label{fig:InfNum}
\end{figure}
As an example, for $N=10$ the energies are much more separated that is reflected also in the angular momenta which show a much weaker mixing than for the other configurations shown.
Not only the unsystematic behaviour, the strong dependence of the angular momentum on the number of spheres as such is surprising since, in principle, the radial and angular nodes should be represented with a similar quality.

\subsubsection{Radial Order}
Using the infinite element scheme, an additional parameter is the order of the radial polynomial $f(r)$ in eq. \ref{eq:Infansatz}.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/BC/OrdInfEL}
\caption{The error in energy for $15$ solutions obtained with a box with radius $r=10$ and $N=40$ spheres using different orders of the multipole expansion $f(r)$, see eq. (\ref{eq:Infansatz}).}
\label{fig:InfOrd}
\end{figure}
The increasing angular momentum with the radial order is, in contrast to the behaviour studied in section \ref{sec:BenchSphere}, not surprising.
As mentioned in section \ref{ch:InfEl}, the  first order infinite element term corresponds to the radial behaviour of an $s$-wave whereas higher radial orders describe the faster decaying waves with respectively larger angular momentum.
Thus, choosing a low radial order ($o=1$) leads to a better representation of low angular momenta and thus is favoured in this context.

\subsection{Conclusion on Boundary Conditions}
The study of different system-parameters presented in the previous sections has revealed several properties of the finite element setup.
An important conclusion of these tests is that a higher density of eigenenergies, which is considered as an indication for a more exact representation of the wave function, in general leads to the appearance af larger angular momenta and, at some point, to strong strong coupling of different angular momenta.
Such a relation is expected for the box-size since a large angular momentum is accompanied by a larger radius, whereas the strong dependence on the number of spheres shown in Figure \ref{fig:InfNum} was not clear in the beginning.

Hence, these studies show that a systematic setup of reasonable parameters is non-trivial and needs to ... the compromise between a dense spectrum and reasonable radial dependence of the wave function on the one side low angular momenta and well-behaved solution on the other side.
It is important to note the importance of the systematic character for such a setup since the computation of a single PES requires the computation of photoelectrons whose kinetic energy may vary over orders of magnitude and thus the box needs to be adapted to this.

%\subsection{Hamiltonian dependence on wave vector}
%Due to the inifinite elements, the Hamiltonian depends on the target momentum $k$ as can be seen in eq. (\ref{eq:SymmKinE}) and (\ref{eq:InFEMmatrix}).
%The nature of this dependence of especial interest since it is a special characteristic of this formulation and another numerical parameter influencing the solutions.
%\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.5\textwidth}

%\caption{Energies of the solutions obtained for target energies varying in the $\mu\,E_h$-range.}
%\label{fig:E_k_bm}
%\end{wrapfigure}
%The obtained energies of the solutions vary strongly when changing the target momentum $k$ as the Figure \ref{fig:E_k_bm} illustrates.
%In the figure, the target energy is varied between $0.566451\,$a. u. and $0.066551\,$a. u. and lead to strongly changing eigenenergies.
%This strong dependence on $k$ is also observed when projecting the obtained FEFs onto spherical waves (\ref{eq:spherWave}) which is not shown here.

\section{Numerical Benchmarks and Stability Tests}
\subsection{Mesh-Construction and Quality}
\label{sec:NumConve}
In section \ref{sec:grid} several parameters for the setup of the grid were discussed whose numerical properties are te compared and evaluated in this section.
Here, three different schemes for distributing the concentric spheres are presented for the Lithium atom, each with a maximum radius $r_\text{max}=7\,$bohr and $N=20$ spheres.
In the scheme denoted in Table \ref{tab:RadScheme} and Figure \ref{fig:SchemHist} (left) as ``const'', the spheres are placed according to eq. (\ref{eq:tm_map}) with $N_i=74$ points on each sphere.
The scheme denoted as tm also uses eq. (\ref{eq:tm_map}) for the size of respective spheres but adapts the number of points per sphere according to (\ref{eq:tm_num}).
The last scheme tested here uses the radial mapping suggested by Son and Chu \cite{Son_Chu0} (\ref{eq:son_map}) and the number of points per sphere (\ref{eq:son_num}).
The parameters for the radial mapping are chosen as $l=1.8$ and $p=2.6$ and for the distribution of points on the spheres the Lebedev-scheme \cite{lebedev} is used, respectively.
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
scheme & runtime [s] & DOS$^{a)}$ [$(m E_h)^{-1}$] & number of nodes\\
\hline
const   &  438   &    7    &   3255 \\
tm      &  825   &    13   &   5132 \\
son     &  891   &    4    &   6368 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{The runtime, density of states and number of nodes used for the different radial mapping schemes that are described in the text.\\
$^{a)}$: density of states, averaged over 23 states}
\label{tab:RadScheme}
\end{table}
Some characteristic properties of the respective results are shown in Table \ref{tab:RadScheme}.
The runtime given in this table is only a rough estimation but seem to scale directly proportional to the number of nodes.
Seemingly the radial mapping scheme (\ref{eq:tm_map}) in combination with the angular density (\ref{eq:tm_num}) seems to be advantageous compared to the others even though it should be noted that this may be different for other parameters and that the density of states in these calculations is not uniform so that an average over more or fewer states can influence the results qualitatively.
However, the results may be very sensitive with respect to the change of parameters such as box-size and the parameter $l$, respectively.
Moreover, during the creation of tetrahedra from the given point-sets a quality-check is done by the respective library \cite{tetgen} which adds or removes points to ensure well-shaped tetrahedra which may, however, alter the distributions considerably.
These corrections of the point-set may be also responsible for the very similar distribution of the properties of the different tetrahedra.
In Figure \ref{fig:SchemHist} (left), the distribution of the ratio of the longest edge to the height of the smallest side is shown.
Here no significant differences between the schemes under investigation can be seen.

The angular distribution of points seems to be only of minor importance.
As shown in the Figures \ref{fig:SchemHist} and \ref{appFig:SchemHist} in supplement, the statistics are very similar and also the obtained density of states is very comparable.
However, the angular distribution can play a larger role when considering non-spherical systems.
In this work unless otherwise noted, the Lebedev scheme is used which provided the highest density of states (DOS) in this test.
The impression of very similar properties of the meshes generated by different schemes is also supported by the statistics of further parameters of the tetrahedra, see Figure \ref{appFig:SchemHist}.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{Figures/Radi_hist.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{Figures/Sph_hist.pdf}
\caption{Distribution of aspect ratio (longest edge length divided by the smallest side height).
   Be aware that the ranges of the different bins differ.}
\label{fig:SchemHist}
\end{figure}
Concluding one can say that the procedures studied here yield meshes with similar quality.

\subsection{Numerical Convergence}
In the FEM scheme used to compute the FEF, several parameters governing numerical and physical characteristics are used such as box-size, target energy and subspace used for solving the eigensystem.

The size of the Krylov-subspace does not play a role for the quality of the solution as shown in Figure \ref{fig:E_nev} for the symmetric formulation with a power $p=\frac 12$ of the damping function $D$.
\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.5\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/Root_E_nev.pdf}
\caption{The energies of the 20 states that fit the target energy best, depending on the
size of the Krylov-suspace, indicated by the colour.}
\label{fig:E_nev}
\end{wrapfigure}
Such a good behaviour can, however, only be observed for the symmetric case because in case of the non-hermitian formulation the ordering of the eigenvalues can not be done unambiguously.

\section{atomic Lithium}
\label{ch:resLI}
As the smallest system that has multiple electrons in its anionic state as well, Lithium is a good test object that has theoretical as well as experimental reference data available, \cite{Li-R,Li-R1, LiNaRef1} even though its appearance in a work on `complex molecules' might surprise.
However, its photoelectron spectrum consists, except for a single valence peak, only of the core electron spectrum.
In this region the estimated binding energies are often not that good as those obtained for valence orbitals and, moreover, two out of four main peaks of the spectrum arise due to dipole-transitions in the bound part and thus are not accounted for due to the neglect of the conjugated Dyson orbital in eq. (\ref{eq:fullDO}) \cite{saPonzi}.
%The appearance of $2p$-states are accessed by a dipole-transition in the bound part and can not be described within the theory applied here due to the neglect of the conjugate DO term in equation (\ref{eq:fullDO}) \cite{saPonzi}.
%Experiment from Moore, cited in \cite{LiNaRef1}; original not found.

However, the well-separated single valence peak allows a more detailed study of the photon energy dependence of the intensity of a single peak as shown in Figure \ref{fig:Li-CS} where experimental values are compared with several theoretical models.
% TODO: this figure in supplement to show comparison with other theoretical results?

\label{fig:Li-CS}
\end{figure}
Since the protocol developed in this work does not provide absolute cross sections, the results obtained here are scaled to fit the reference data best.
Moreover, it was shown in chapter \ref{ch:bmSize} that the size of the FEM-region plays an important role for the nature of the obtained solutions but no conclusive scheme for a reasonable choice for the radius has been given so far.

\section{water}
The PES and threshold PES, where the kinetic energy of the photoelectron is kept constant instead of the energy of the photon, of water is experimentally well studied 
for different photon energies.
As example, in Ref. \cite{waterTPE} the PES of water and several TPES of water and heavy water are investigated with high resolution.\\
Similar high accuracy is achieved in Ref. \cite{waterHePES} where the PES of H$_2$O$^+$ and D$_2$O$^+$ are studied with a He1 source, radiating at $537\,$Angs.\\
Further PES are available at higher photon energies:
In \cite{water1200}, photons at energies of $1200\,$eV are used.
A further study of Winter \textit{et. al.} measured spectra at $60$, $75$ $80$, $100$ and $120\,$eV in gas and liquid phase \cite{winterWater}.\\
These studies are of interest here since they yield a variety of different test-cases on a single system that can be used to prove the method being used to be valid.
