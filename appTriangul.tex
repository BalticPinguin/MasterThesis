\section{Delaunay Triangulation}
\label{app:delaunay}
The explicit setup of non-regular meshes for the use in finite element schemes is not trivial at all.
There are however schemes available, among which are the Delaunay and Voronoi tesselations which are their respective dual schemes.
Since in this thesis, only Delaunay tesselation is used, I will focus on this method and its properties only.\\
In mathematics one understands under a triangulation a connection of points to simplices.
Thereby a structure is denoted as a simplex in $n$ dimensions, if has as few vertices as possible in this dimension.
A simplex in $2D$ \textit{e.g.} is a triangle while it is in $3D$ a tetrahedron.
Moreover, a simplex is denoted as Delaunay simplex if there is a circumsphere such that no vertex is inside of this sphere.\\
A bit more intuitive acess to this scheme can be obtained via the Voronoi diagram: A Voronoi diagram splits a given volume (in $3D$) into elements using a set of points $p_i$ in this volume by assigning each point to the element of his nearest point $p_i$.
Having this tesselation, one can transform it to a set of Delaunay simplices by connecting the points $p_i$ each with their direct neighbours \cite{tetgen}.
