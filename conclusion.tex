\subsection{Boundary condition}
The dependence of density of eigenenergies to size/mixing of angular momenutum can also hold for the different formulations of infinite elements, compared in section \ref{ch:bmFormul}, as well.
Thus, a comparison of the different formulations could be redone under this aspect, probably leading to better results.
However, previous studies that are not presented in this work have shown that the Astley-Leis elements leads to similar problems which initially motivated the symmetric formulation.

 - is it worth the effort?
 - What energy-range is achievable?
 - Which effects are still missing?

 - How to proceed with it?
